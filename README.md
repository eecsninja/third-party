third-party
===========

This repository contains copies of code from other projects that are dependencies of the other repositories.  This typically means the code is published but not very broadly adopted, and no prebuilt libraries may be available.  

The mirror repo serves two purposes:
1. Code in other repositories need this code to be built.  Instead of going to each project's site and downloading the respective source, it can be obtained here all at once.
2. If a third-party project shuts down and the code is no longer available, the mirror repo still retains that code.
